LUA include for PureBasic
=====

Here you can download my translation of the c lua header files into PureBasic includes.
Additionally there is a small example which shows how to utilize lua from PB.

## Usage
To make lua work on Windows you have to copy the according (x86 or x64) shared library (*.dll) into the same folder as your application.
The *.dll files can be found in "Libraries\Lua\Binaries\Windows\x__\", for linux no files have to be copied because lua will be linked statically.

## License
Lua itself is distributed under the terms of the MIT license.
